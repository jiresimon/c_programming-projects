#  2X2 MATRIX ARITHMETIC OPERATION USING 2-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

The program uses the concept of indexing of 2-dimensional arrays to write a code for two arithmetic operations -- addition and subtraction of matrices.

Program accepts users' input for an arithmetic operation and computes the answers.

A switch case approach is used to handle the users' input on whether it's subtraction or addition.
